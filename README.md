# Guardian-UK-COVID
A public claim on the Guardian of London

CC email.

## JAKE MACKENZIE VS THE GUARDIAN

Dear Moneyclaim, and St Katharine's House,

Thank you for presiding over this case.

I received Mr Adriano's thoughtfully written response pack by email, on the 25th of July.

I am outside the UK right now, so cannot fill in paperwork in person. I hope this written testimonial will suffice. 

I am requesting that this process take place 100% online.

I certainly do not wish to abuse or obstruct any court process, as claimed by GMN and Mr Adriano, in 10(3.2) of their response.

In fact, it is the Guardian's virus and vaccine coverage that abused the goodwill and credulity of the worldwide public. Vaccine worries contributed towards travel and business restrictions in the UK and South East Asia, from 2020 to 2023. 

I have never taken anyone to court before, and I am simply asking that this case be overseen by fair, impartial judges in St Katharine's House, Northhampton. 

## Mediation is Requested

Like the defendant, The Guardian, I seek a speedy resolution. 

I would also prefer to resolve this case with no trial. I am open to mediation with a moneyclaim officer, as long as I get a financial settlement which reflects both damages incurred, and the time I have spent compiling this case.

I have presented my case online, here... as I am still formatting my writing.

Please tell me what steps I need to take next to bring a swift end to this process. 

Faithfully,

Jake Mackenzie

## CASE FOLLOWS

# How The Guardian's Biased Vaccine Coverage Damaged UK + Taiwanese Society, Business, and My Personal Income, from February 2020, to Summer 2023

I swear, under penalty of perjury, the following testimonial is a true and faithful account of facts, to the best of my recollection.

#### * I'm claiming against the Guardian, because their negligent fact-checking contributed towards a worldwide virus and vaccine panic, which caused the following chain of events;

## ONE. 24 to 36 months of psychological social pressure, and financial coercion, to take untested, unsafe vaccines. The Guardian ignored, dismissised or minimized vaccine side-effects many times. 


## Vaccine side effects... what you should know, and why you shouldn't worry.

### I saw friends and colleagues in Taipei suffer from nerve damage, chronic fatigue, Bell's Palsy and other ill health effects, very soon after they took their shots. These health effects are hardly mild or short-lived, as the Guardian negligently claimed on March 18th, 2021: 


https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/18/covid-vaccine-side-effects-pfizer-moderna-johnson-is-it-safe


## TWO. The citizens of Taipei, and the UK, endured 24 to 36 months of overseas travel restrictions. I could not travel to Indonesia for 3-4 years, as I was worried about unsafe, untested vaccines and serious medical side-effects. The Guardian supported both the vaccine and lockdown narrative in South East Asia. 

On the 19th of March 2020, The Guardian claimed that China's coronavirus lockdown strategy was 'brutal but effective'.

Furthermore, On Friday 9th of December 2022, this periodical claimed that "without effective vaccines, China's economy may not heal." 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/accfc798-5e11-43ba-a2fa-7e996f0b21a0)

With these articles, and many others, the Guardian cheerled a draconian Virus-Lockdown-Vaccine triptych, which may have cemented policy changes in the UK and SouthEast Asia. With their 'Brutal but effective' commentary, they are going far beyond neutral reporting, and in fact condoning police-state repression. As a very close neighbour of China, Taiwan's policy may have been substantially influenced by the Guardian's medical negligence, and political overreach. 

### 3. I endured 18-24 months of Psychological pressure from family in the UK, and colleagues at work, to take a vaccine. Detailed email screengrabs follow.  The Guardian's assurances of the safety and efficacy of these vaccines caused many to take a hardline view of those who decided to remain safely unvaccinated. At work, and on transport, we were treated as second class citizens.


#### From 2020 to 2023, I lost work in Taipei, as a direct result of Virus and Vaccine Hysteria. A hysteria which is directly, personally, and negligently, the fault of the UK Guardian of London.

### 4. Loss of two to three years teaching income, from my employment in a previously thriving business in central Taipei. Loss of students and income was primarily due to vaccine mandates, as I shall prove in many screengrabbed emails. If the Guardian and their allies had not launched the COVID 



Many UK citizens experienced the same situation, both at home in the UK, and abroad. Businesses were closed, income was sharply reduced. The Guardian is very much responsible for the facts they choose to report.  


## The Guardian promoted a vaccine panic

When the vaccines were released, in 2021 and 2022, there was no care taken to ensure that there was an appropriate testing period, to guard against side-effects, toxins, and long term health effects.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66bc29fc-cdac-4898-b845-7be868d86e5a)


The Guardian's promotion of vaccines was both reckless and biased. In the initial stages, they did nothing to question the lucrative narratives being pushed by pharmaceutical companies, who stood to make hundreds of millions from vaccine contracts.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77d9c095-f004-4205-a598-40fee371296b)


This promotion of vaccines in the Guardian's coverage, amounts to medical coercion, where those who were unvaccinated, were asked to stay at home. MORE

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/from-nasal-vaccines-to-pills-the-next-defences-against-covid

The vaccines were rushed out, without a proper testing period. The Guardian knew this, chose to ignore the dangers, and put the health of many British citizens at risk, both in the UK, and abroad, as their periodical is read worldwide.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/01/texas-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-lawsuit-effectiveness

The Guardian's pushing of the COVID narrative contributed to worldwide lockdowns, where many people, including myself, lost significant income. My income in Taipei went from an average of 1000 pounds per month, to 300, as students were ordered to stay at home. The Guardian's pushing of the pharmaceutical narrative contributed directly to this situation.

I therefore believe the Guardian's coverage of the virus and vaccine to be negligent, psychologically hurtful, financially damaging to millions of livelihoods, and a contribution towards the violation of several basic human rights...

## My Employer, Core Corner of Taipei, lost 80% of its students as a direct result of Virus and Vaccine Panic.

#### Not only were UK citizens in the UK and abroad ordered to stay home, but a once thriving Corporate Training business in the centre of Taipei, Core Corner of Zhongxiao Fuxing, lost 80% of its one-on-one consultation business. Students were asked to sit at home, or not come to class. The lcokdowns, claimed The Guardian of London, were supposedly because of a deadly virus. The only solution offered by the Media-Pharmaceutical-Transport complex were Draconian freedom restrictions, and dangerous vaccines. Throughout the pandemix, the Guardian lost any impoartiality they may have had before, and instead became proponents of vaccines, and vaccine mandates. Vaccines, and vaccines mandates which were medically lucrative, untested and spurious. 

#### I lost 80% of my income, causing severe financial hardship in my partment in North Taipei for 3 years. 

#### The education sector in the whole of Taipei lost so much work, that I lost an estimated 15 to 20,000 pounds in income over 24-26 months. I eventually left Taiwan to look for work elsewhere, which caused another hit to my savings. There is a direct link between the Guardians negligent fact-checking, the vaccines mandates in South East Asia, and the subsequent loss of income from many hard-working, sincere teachers. 

#### *Virus and Vaccine hysteria, caused directly by the Guardian and other UK periodicals, caused widespread problems in the Taipei business community, and the South East Asian transport industry. I had to delay travel plans for 3 to 4 years, while the fictitious profit-driven pandemic played out.

## Core and Corner Vaccine Coercion

My business life and income in Taipei was severely affected by aggresive vaccine promotion from media, business and family. The Guardian UK was one of the primary drivers of the worldwide panic.

You can see in the following emails, that heavy pressure was placed upon teachers to get vaccinated, from governments, bosses, and the worldwide media. 

- This pressure came as a result of virus hype from The Guardian. A self-proclaimed online 'newspaper' that is read by many company bosses in South East Asia.

### December 5th 2021, Vaccine Mandate. Teachers to to take two doses of vaccines, else no work.

### All teachers must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or be subject to constant testing.

## The Guardian took part in Vaccine Intimidation

The people of the United Kingdom, and myself, were forced to sit at home, doing little business, and not flying abroad, while more vulnerable members of our society were intimidated, by The Guardian, into taking experimental vaccines which had hardly been tested. 


Nasal Swabs, intimidate...

 So, if you haven’t done so yet, try to get that booster shot as soon as possible.

This all means that there is now a greater risk that at some point you might become infected or be identified as a close contact.

In order for Core & Corner to comply with this mandate the Teachers who are unwilling or unable to either be fully vaccinated or provide weekly test results will unfortunately only be permitted to do out-of-office on-line classes from 1st January 2022. 

Have a good Christmas and stay Covid free for 2022.

Kind regards

Derek
